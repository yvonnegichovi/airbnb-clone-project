# Airbnb Clone Project - StayBackend

## Overview
This is a backend implementation of an Airbnb-like booking platform. The goal is to build a robust, scalable system that handles users, listings, bookings, payments, and more, using modern backend technologies and best practices.

## Project Goals
- Build a real-world backend application using Django
- Practice relational database modeling with MySQL
- Implement RESTful APIs with proper security
- Set up CI/CD for continuous deployment
- Learn collaborative team development with GitHub

## Team Roles

A successful software project requires a well-defined team structure with clear responsibilities. Below are the key roles involved in the Airbnb Clone backend project:

### 👨‍💻 Backend Developer
Responsible for writing the server-side application logic. In this project, they build APIs using Django, manage user authentication, handle requests and responses, and ensure business logic is implemented correctly.

### 🧠 Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and maintains the project's relational database. They define data schemas, relationships, indexes, and ensure data integrity and security using MySQL.

### 🧪 QA Engineer
Ensures the application meets quality standards by writing and executing test cases. They focus on identifying bugs and verifying that all features perform as intended, including API testing with tools like Postman or automated test frameworks.

### 🛡️ DevOps Engineer
Handles CI/CD pipeline setup and infrastructure management. They automate testing and deployment using tools like GitHub Actions and Docker, ensuring consistent and smooth delivery of updates.

### 📝 Technical Writer / Documentation Specialist
Responsible for writing clear, concise, and accurate project documentation. This includes the README, API docs, database schemas, and team contributions.

### 🧭 Project Manager (PM)
Oversees project planning, task assignment, and timeline management. The PM ensures that the team is aligned with the goals and delivers on time while coordinating communication and workflow.

### 🧑‍🎨 UI/UX Designer *(optional in backend-focused projects)*
While primarily frontend, this role may be involved in API contracts and ensuring backend endpoints align with frontend expectations, even if not actively coding in this phase.
